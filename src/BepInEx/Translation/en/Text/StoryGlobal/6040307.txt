温泉について=All About the Hot Spring
突発的に湧いた温泉がこんな形で役に立つなんてね。\n最初にあんな派手な浴場を見たときは反応に困ったけど、\nそれも込みでみんな楽しんでくれてるみたいね。=I can't believe a hot spring that sprung up so unexpectedly could actually\nbe this useful to us. When I first saw the showy bathhouse, I didn't know\nhow to react. But it seems like our guests are enjoying that too.
さすがプロデューサー=That's Producer for you.
自然も楽しめる。=They can also admire nature.
温泉ギルドになるのかな？=Maybe you'll become a hot spring guild.
ここまで見越してたのかしら？\nだとしたら本当にすごいけど……単純に自己顕示欲な気も……\nい、いえ！　みんな喜んでるからいいのよね！=Maybe she knew what was coming? Which would mean she\nreally is amazing... Or maybe she simply wanted the limelight...\nE-either way, everyone's happy, so it's all good!
そうねぇ。私たちにとっては当たり前だけど、\n街の人たちにとって牧場は景色も癒しなのよね。\n牛たちとの触れ合いも楽しめれば、もっといいのにね。=They sure can. It might be nothing special to us, but for the townsfolk,\nthe scenery on the ranch could help them to recuperate. It would be\neven better if they could also enjoy interacting with the cows.
それはそれで楽しそうだけど私が木を切って、\nマヒルちゃんが牛たちの世話をして、シオリちゃんが警備をして、\nリンちゃんが……サボる？　そんな牧場が一番よ。=That does sound like a ton of fun. I'd be chopping down trees, Mahiru\nwould be taking care of the cows, Shiori would be on guard duty, and\nRin would be... skipping work? Well, that's the dream, right?
