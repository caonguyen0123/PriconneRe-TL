あ～もう、海水でビショビショじゃない！\nもう海は勘弁してほしいわね。\nさっさと帰ってシャワー浴びた～い。=Argh! Now I'm soaking wet from all the seawater!\nUgh, I've had enough of the sea.\nI just wanna go straight home and take a shower!
でもせっかく海に来たんですし、\nちょっとだけ浜辺のほうに行ってみませんか？=But we've already come all this way,\nso why don't we head down to the beach for a bit?
わたくしは主さまさえよければ構いませんが。=I have no qualms with that so long as my lord allows it.
少し時間もありますし、海水浴でも……\nって、キャルちゃんは泳げないんでしたね。=We've got some time to spare, so why don't we take a dip in the water?\nOh, that's right. You can't swim, huh, Karyl?
べ、べつに泳げないわけじゃないけど！\nでも今日は気分じゃないかなーって思っただけよ。\n本当に泳げないわけじゃないんだからねっ！=Wh-who said I can't swim?!\nI was just thinking that I didn't feel like swimming today, that's all.\nJust so we're clear, it's not like I can't swim or anything! Got it?!
