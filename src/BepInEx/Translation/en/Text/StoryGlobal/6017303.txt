ラムたちの世界=Ram's Home World
ラムたちの世界=Ram's Home World
ここは賑やかな街よね。\nラムの世界にも賑やかな場所はあったけれど、\nラムたちは普段ずっと館の中にしかいないものだから。=This is such a busy city.\nIn our world, there were busy places as well,\nbut we spent most of our time in that big empty mansion.
故郷はどんなところ？=What was it like where you came from?
賑やかな場所ってどんな？=What kind of busy places?
館の中はどんな感じ？=What's it like living in a mansion?
どんなところ、と言われると説明しにくいけれど。\n記憶喪失なら、まずは自分のいる世界のことを\n知る方が先決でしょうね。説明が面倒とかではないわよ。=What was it like? That's not very easy to explain.\nIf you've lost your memories, maybe you should try learning\nabout your own world first. It's not that I can't be bothered.
王都……まぁ、人のごった返す場所よ。\nここと大差ない、と言いたいけれど、どうかしらね。\n闇に隠されている部分もそうなのかしら。=The capital... Well, it was packed with people.\nMuch like this city, I'd like to say, but I wonder.\nDoes that go for their shadowy underbellies too?
そうね……掃除する場所が多いわ。\n花壇の手入れや洗濯なんかも大変ね。\nまぁ、主にやっているのはレムだけれど。=Let's see... It's a huge pain to clean.\nFull of flowers to water and clothes to wash.\nThough it's Rem who does almost all of that.
