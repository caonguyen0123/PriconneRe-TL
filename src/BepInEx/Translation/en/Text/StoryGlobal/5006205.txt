また現れた！\nさっきと同じ敵、みたいだね……！=There it is again!\nThat's the same enemy as before, right?
お、おかしいッス！\n倒したはずッスよ！？=Wh-what's going on?!\nDidn't we defeat it back there?!
いや、別の個体だな。\n明らかに纏う空気が違う。\n中々の獲物みたいじゃないか！=No... This is a different specimen.\nIts aura is on a different level.\nPerhaps this one will put up more of a fight!
なるほど、クリスちゃんの言う通りみたいだ。\n油断は禁物だな。=I see... It does indeed seem more fearsome.\nWe must stay vigilant.
