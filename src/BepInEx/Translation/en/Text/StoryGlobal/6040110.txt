ハンゾウはどこへ消えた=Where Did Hanzo Go?
見捨てられた監査官、少し憐れだったべ。\nそれにしてもハンゾウって人はどこに消えたんだべ……\n同情する必要なんかねぇはずなんだけどな。=I feel kinda sorry for the inspector gettin' hung out to dry like that.\nAn' jus' where the heck did that Hanzo character disappear to...?\nNot that I should be sympathizin' though, huh?
闇から闇へ消えた。=From the dark he came; into the dark he went.
いつか捕まる。=He'll get caught one day.
案外そばに居るのかも……=Maybe he's closer than we think...
そんな感じだったな。なんかの魔法だったんだべか。\n王宮騎士団も見つけられてねぇんだから、相当のやり手だったんだべな。\nいや～、オラたちそんなのによく勝てたな。=That's sure how it seems. I guess it's some special kinda magic.\nIt must be a mighty formidable technique if Nightmare can't even\nfind him. Crazy how we managed to win against that.
因果応報、だべな。きちんと罪を償ってほしいべや。\nこれ以上つらい目にあう人は出てほしくねぇべ。=Jus' deserts, huh? Fate willing, he'll be made to pay for his crimes.\nI sure hope nobody else is made to suffer by his hand.
そ、そんなこえぇこと言うもんでねぇ！\nけんど、本当に神出鬼没だったから、いきなり現れても\n不思議でねぇな。出てきたらがんばって捕まえてやるべさ！=D-don't say such scary things! But he is the kind to show up\nunexpectedly, so I wouldn't be surprised if he jus' popped outta the\nshadows.If he does, I'll turn him into shish kebab with this here bident.
