ふぅ～手ごわかったですね～\nキャルちゃん、魔物のことにも詳しいんですね。=Phew. That was a tough one.\nYou sure know your stuff when it comes to monsters, huh, Karyl.
ま……まぁ聞いた話よ。実際に見たのは初めてだわ。\nこんなところにいるヤツじゃないと思ってたけど……\n何か異変でもあったのかしら？=Well... I mean, it's just stuff I've heard. That was the first time \nI ever actually saw one. I didn't think that was something you'd \nusually see around here. I wonder if something weird happened?
それにしても、今夜は大漁ですね♪\nうふふっ、晩御飯が楽しみです！　どこからがいいですかねぇ～♪\nトロかなぁ～かまかなぁ～ヒレかなぁ～？=Who cares? We've got a huge catch for tonight! *giggle* \nI'm really looking forward to dinner! I wonder what I should eat first?\nThe belly? Or the collar? Or maybe the fins?
あんたやめなさいよ、その妙な趣味！\nあたしは絶対に魔物なんか食べないからね！\n見張ってなきゃ、何の肉を食べさせられることか……ぶつぶつ……=Will you cut that out already? Your tastes are so weird! I'm never \neating a single bite of any monster! I gotta keep a close eye on you. \nWho knows what kind of weird meat you'll try to feed me... *grumble*
