故郷のこと=A Place to Call Home
前にも言ったと思うが、\nぼくはこの学院に入るまで里を下りたことがなかった。\n街を捨てた老学者たちと、彼らの膨大な蔵書が親代わりだったんだ。=I may have mentioned before,\nbut prior to entering this academy, I'd never left my village.\nI was raised by reclusive elders and their volumes of scholarly tomes.
里とは？=What village did you come from?
老学者たちとは？=Who were these elders?
親代わりとは？=Why were you raised by them?
ふむ……地名を挙げたところで分かる者はおるまい。\nこの街からは馬車で数日かかる山奥の寂れた集落さ。\n若者と呼べる世代はぼく以外いなかった。つまり里一番の美女だぜ。=Hrm... I could give the name, but few would recognize it. It's a lonely\nhamlet deep in the mountains, several days' ride from the city. And I was\nthe only youth there to speak of. You might call me the village beauty.
頑固で偏屈な捻くれ爺どもさ。当人たちは街を捨てたと言うが……\nまあ、学会というのも一つの社会だ、馴染めない者もいるだろう。\nぼくにとっては皆、愛すべき家族だがね。=Oh, just a bunch of stubborn old fools. They say they \"tired of the city,\"\nbut... Well, academic circles are like social cliques. Some people just...\ndon't fit in. Though at least to me, they're all my precious family.
ふむ……ぼく自身は、昔のことを覚えていなくてね。\nもっとも、赤子の頃の記憶があるものなど何処にもおるまいが。\nまあ、そういう意味では君と似たようなものだよ、同志。=Hrm... I don't have any memories of my younger days.\nOf course, precious few people do recall their actual infancy.\nStill, in that sense, you could say we're alike, you and I.
