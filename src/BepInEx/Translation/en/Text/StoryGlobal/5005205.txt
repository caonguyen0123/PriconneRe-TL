また島クジラが出てきたにゃ！\nでも、どーってことないのにゃ。次も軽くひねってやるにゃ！！=Another Island Whale to fight!\nBut that's nyo problem for us. We'll send him flying into next week!
待ってタマキさん！\nこの島クジラ、さっきのとはなんだか違うわ。=Wait a moment, Tamaki!\nThis whale seems somehow different from the one we fought before!
確かに、お腹を空かせた猫みたいなピリっとした空気を感じるにゃ。\n油断せずに戦うにゃ！=You're right... There's a fierce gleam in its eyes,\nlike a cat who hasn't eaten in weeks...\nLet's keep our wits about us!
