や、やりました……！\n嘆きの女神を倒しましたよ、カスミさん！=W-we did it, Kasumi!\nWe defeated the Goddess of Woe!
……ちょっと待ちたまえ。\n私がもし、敵を欺く為に姿を隠すならば……こっちか！=...Don't get ahead of yourself.\nIf I were to hide myself to deceive the enemy, then... I'd hide here!
あっ！？\nこ、こんなところに道があります！=Wha?!\nI-I never even knew there was a path here!
地図にない裏道というやつだね。\nおそらく、この先に嘆きの女神が居る。\n気を引き締めよう、戦いはまだこれからのようだ。=It's one of those paths you won't find on maps.\nIf the Goddess of Woe is anywhere to found, it's beyond here.\nThe battle's only just begun. Don't let your guards down.
