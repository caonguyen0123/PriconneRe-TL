リンについて=All About Rin
リンちゃんはやればできる子だと思ってたけど、\n本当にすごいがんばりよね。\n私も負けないようにたくさん働くわ！=I knew that Rin could accomplish whatever she put her mind to, but it\nturns out she's super tenacious too. I'm going to work even harder so\nthat she doesn't make me look bad.
反動が怖いね。=I'm afraid of the blowback.
ご褒美をあげないと。=She deserves a reward.
仲間思いだよね。=She's doing it for her friends.
と思いつつ、ダラけてる姿が恋しくなってる私もいるのよね……\nリンちゃんには言わないけど、あれも平和な牧場って感じだったし。=At the same time, I'm also one to miss watching her laze around...\nI wouldn't tell her that, but it's part and parcel of peaceful times\nat our ranch.
リンちゃんへのご褒美……休み以外に何かあるかしら。\nドングリ……は自分で集めるのも楽しんでそうだし。\n一緒にゲームとか、できたらいいのにな。=A reward for Rin...? What is there other than time off work?\nAcorns... are something she seems to enjoy gathering on her own.\nMaybe we could play one of her games with her.
リンちゃんは照れてごまかすでしょうけど、\n本当に牧場のことを大切に思ってるわよね。\nもう少し素直になってくれればいいのに。=She'd probably get embarrassed and dodge the subject, but she really\ndoes care a lot about Elizabeth Park. I just wish she'd be a little more\nhonest about her feelings.
