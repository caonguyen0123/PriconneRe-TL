マヒルの衣装について=Mahiru's Outfit
マヒルちゃんの戦闘装束、とってもかわいい……なんて言ったら\nマヒルちゃんに怒られちゃうわね。\nけど、ねぇ……？=When Mahiru wears her battle attire, she looks totally adorable...\nI want to tell her, but she'll definitely get mad at me.\nBut, right...?
かわいいからしかたない。=She is what she is.
おとなのみりょくだよ。=She has adult charm.
かっこいいよね。=She looks cool, huh?
やっぱりそうよねぇ♪\nあんなにかわいいんだからもっとそこを押し出せばいいのに。\n無理して大人ぶる必要なんかないわよ。=So you think so too! ♪\nIf I were that cute, I'd be doing as much as I could\nto emphasize it. There's no need for her to force herself to look mature.
そうね。おとなのみりょくよね。\nおへそとかでてて、とってもせくしーだものね。\nって！　思ってないことは無理して言わなくていいのよ！？=Yeah. She has loads of adult charm, right?\nShe's so sexy with her belly button out, isn't she?\nHey! You don't have to say what you don't really think!
男の子の目から見るとそうなるの？\n言われてみれば確かにそうかもしれないわね。\nマヒルちゃんの新しい魅力だわ。=Is that how you see it as a boy?\nWell, now that you mention it, she does look pretty awesome.\nIt's Mahiru's new charm.
