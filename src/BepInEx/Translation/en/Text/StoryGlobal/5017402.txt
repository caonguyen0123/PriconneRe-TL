『怠惰』を一閃=Slayers of Sloth
完全に消滅させたわけではありませんが、\nなんとか撃退できたようです！=He may not be completely destroyed yet,\nbut we won this battle, at least!
とりあえず、ひと段落といった感じかしら。\n今日はラムも働きすぎたし、早く帰ってゆっくりしたいわ。=I suppose we have time to catch our breath.\nAfter all this hard work, I'd like to go home and rest.
疲れた時は素直に休むのがすごーく大事だけど、\n今はもう少しだけ頑張りましょう！=Resting properly is very important when you're tired,\nbut right now, I think we still have work to do!
