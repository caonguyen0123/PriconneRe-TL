ハンゾウはどこへ消えた=Where Did Hanzo Go?
ハンゾウのやつどこに消えたんだろ。\nあいつも捕まえないと終わった気がしないよ。=I wonder what the heck happened to Hanzo.\nI won't feel like this is all over until he's been caught.
闇から闇へ消えた。=From the dark he came; into the dark he went.
いつか捕まる。=He'll get caught one day.
案外そばに居るのかも……=Maybe he's closer than we think...
ほんとにそんな感じだよね。\nハンゾウたちは金で動いてただけみたいだから\n安心していいんだろうけど……なんだかな～=It honestly seems that way, huh?\nHe and his cronies only did what they did for the sake of money,\nso I guess we can rest easy... But still.
あいつらを捕まえるのは相当大変そうだけど、捕まってほしいね。\nあたしを働かせた報いを受けるがいいよ。=I bet capturing him and his underlings won't be a simple task.\nBut I have my fingers crossed.\nI wanna flay him for causing me to work so hard.
そんな足が付く真似はしないでしょ。\nきっともう遠くに逃げてるよ。\nほんと、あいつらの姿は二度と見たくないなぁ。=The last thing he wants is to be easily found.\nSo I'm sure he's already a million miles away.\nHonestly, I don't ever wanna see him or his subordinates ever again.
